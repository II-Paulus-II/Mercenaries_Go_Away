[h1]Do you hate mercenaries?[/h1]

Join the club.

Now Updated for 2.0.3 - 18th March

A minor upgrade.

1. Character Interactions where you send a member of your family away as a merc now do not lose 5 martial but 1 charisma.

[b]As Before[/b]

2. Merc modifier is now correctly only 1 charisma, so that mercenary generals are no longer OP - it got changed from the trait.

3. Much reduced numbers of mercenaries - only 1 per region. 

Enjoy!
